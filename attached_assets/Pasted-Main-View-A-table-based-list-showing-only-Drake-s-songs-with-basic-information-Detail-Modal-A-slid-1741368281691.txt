Main View: A table-based list showing only Drake's songs with basic information
Detail Modal: A slide-over modal that appears when a song is selected, displaying comprehensive split information with visual representation

Data Structure
I'll provide a CSV file with the following structure:

Title: Song title
Artist: Main credited artists
Split_Type: Category of contribution (Music, Lyrics, Instruments)
Contributor: Specific person or role responsible
Split_Percentage: Percentage allocation
Status: Claimed/Unclaimed/Intermediate

Main View Requirements

Create a clean, minimal table displaying Drake's song catalog
Table columns should include:

Song Number/Position
Title
Featured Artists (if any)
Album/Collection


Only show one entry per song (not separate rows for each split)
Use a simple black, white, and blue color scheme
Include a search/filter functionality to find songs quickly
Songs should be clickable to open the detail modal

Detail Modal Requirements

Create a slide-over modal that appears when a song is selected
Modal header should display:

Song title
Main artists
Album/collection


Main modal content should include:

Song Information: Show title, all artists, and overall status
Split Visualization: Create three horizontal stacked bar charts for:

Music Rights: Show percentage splits between contributors
Lyrics Rights: Show percentage splits between contributors
Instruments/Production: Show percentage splits between contributors


Use different shades of blue to represent different contributors in the bars
Include a small legend identifying each contributor
Display the percentage number within each section of the bar when space permits
Show the status (Claimed/Unclaimed/Intermediate) for each split with a small indicator


Modal footer should have two buttons:

"Edit Splits" button
"Delete Song" button (with confirmation dialog)



Visual Design

Use a minimalist design with plenty of white space
Color scheme: Black text, white background, blue accents and visualization bars
Use different shades of blue for the split visualization sections
Make the interface responsive for different screen sizes
Use clean, readable typography

Technical Requirements

Build using React or a similar modern framework
Parse the provided CSV for data management
Include proper error handling and loading states
Ensure all percentage splits for each Split_Type category always add up to 100%
Make the UI interactive with smooth transitions for the modal

Sample Visualization Example
For example, if "Privileged Rappers" is selected:

Music Rights Bar:

Drake: 50% (medium blue)
21 Savage: 50% (light blue)


Lyrics Rights Bar:

Drake: 50% (medium blue)
21 Savage: 50% (light blue)


Instruments Bar:

Vocals (Drake): 25% (darkest blue)
Vocals (21 Savage): 25% (dark blue)
Audio Engineer: 25% (medium blue) - marked as "Unclaimed"
Producer: 25% (light blue)



Each section of the bar should be visually proportional to the percentage and include the contributor name and percentage when hovered.
Additional Features (if time permits)

Add ability to create new songs and splits
Include a summary dashboard showing Drake's overall share across the catalog
Add filtering by split status (to quickly see unclaimed splits)
Include animation for the modal transitions and bar loading

The application should be intuitive to use and provide clear visual representation of complex split data, while maintaining a clean, professional appearance.
